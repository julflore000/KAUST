# KAUST
This repo contains the work I have done and any presentations I made on my work around the sustainability surrounding green ammonia and hydrogen production at KAUST for the summer in relevance to Saudi Arabia.

* Note: the workweek in Saudi Arabia is from Sunday-> Thursday and thus structured my weekly journal in accordance.

## Week 1
**Weekly Goal:** Get situated in KAUST, meet your working group, and just soak everything in!

* **Sunday** 
    * Arrived at KAUST, check in, got my KAUST ID
* **Monday**
    * Continue the logistical work getting my respective SIM card and continuing the exploration of KAUST for the first time
* **Tuesday**
    * Grab lunch with one of my coworkers and explore the building of where I will be working at while continuing exploration
* **Wednesday**
    * Start on Mani's readings working through a deep dive into hydrogen and ammonia production and all the various production/transportation possibilities
* **Thursday**
    * Knocked off three of Mani's recommended readings and start work on initial presentation over the weekend


## Week 2
**Weekly Goal:** Finish up initial readings and make first weekly presentation summarizing content reviewed
