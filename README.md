# Green Ammonia and Hydrogen Supply Chain Optimization Work
This repo contains the work I have done and any presentations I made on my work around the supply chain surrounding green ammonia and hydrogen production at KAUST for the summer.

## “Green” Ammonia: Impact of Renewable Energy Intermittency on Plant Sizing and Levelized Cost of Ammonia- Richard Nayak-Luke, RenéBañares-Alcantara, and Ian Wilkinson ##
* This work provides the main foundation for the supply chain model in terms of hydrogen and ammonia production

* CAPEX is calculated from a factorial equation KS^(n) where K is the cost constant, S is the characteristic size of the plant in kW or mean tonne/day of ammonia produced, and n is the index for electrolyzer, ASU (air seperation unit), and Haber-Bosch process

* OPEX taken as 5% of CAPEX
