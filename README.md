# KAUST
This repo contains the work I have done and any presentations I made on my work around the sustainability surrounding green ammonia and hydrogen production at KAUST for the summer in relevance to Saudi Arabia.

* Note: the workweek in Saudi Arabia is from Sunday-> Thursday and thus structured my weekly journal in accordance.

## Week 1
**Weekly Goal:** Get situated in KAUST, meet your working group, and just soak everything in!

* **Sunday** 
    * Arrived at KAUST, check in, got my KAUST ID
* **Monday**
    * Continue the logistical work getting my respective SIM card and continuing the exploration of KAUST for the first time
* **Tuesday**
    * Grab lunch with one of my coworkers and explore the building of where I will be working at while continuing exploration
* **Wednesday**
    * Start on Mani's readings working through a deep dive into hydrogen and ammonia production and all the various production/transportation possibilities
* **Thursday**
    * Knocked off three of Mani's recommended readings and start work on initial presentation over the weekend


## Week 2
**Weekly Goal:** Finish up initial readings and make first weekly presentation summarizing content reviewed

* **Sunday**
    * Finished up readings and sent out email on next steps
* **Monday**
    * Reviewed work done by former student-come up with plan for next steps and flow of what I would like to accomplish
    * Start LaTex outline of the optimization model
* **Tuesday**
    * Review supply chain work and write up questions for Thursday meeting
* **Wednesday**
    * Review Matlab code and confirm creating new code repo
* **Thursday**
    * Meeting with Alabbad and Mani clarify project direction (will be focusing on entire plant optimization from a theoretical perspective and want to compare tradeoffs of financial security vs optimal sizing)

## Week 3
**Weekly Goal:** Set up optimization model outline w/ schematic of the entire model we will be optimizing (in the production stage)

* **Sunday**
    * Draw up value chain for green ammonia plant
    * Develop optimization model-get all parameters
* **Monday**
    * Finish writing up optimization initial draft
    * Write up initial draft of model in code
* **Tuesday**
    * Put equation variables onto the more detailed supply chain and set up model for test runs
* **Wednesday**
    * Get initial outputs from model-make sure visually everything looks realistic
    * Develop basic data walkthrough of model in jupyter
    * Next steps: go through the model formulation and make sure equations line up with representation of reality
* **Thursday**
    * Added discount factor calculation to OPEXs for each technology
    * Developed visuals on costs from each technology impact on final $/kg of green ammonia produced
    * Met with Abbad to go over current model structure and flow in prep for meeting on Sunday w/ Shashank

## Week 4
**Weekly Goal:** Collect relevant lit values and see if we can replicate common LCOA

* **Sunday**
    * To do:
        * Go through each of the system input parameters to see what data we need and find sources
        * Once feedback is received from Shashank-make any changes (if no changes-send diagram flow over to Mani for confirmation)
* **Monday**
    * Run through model checking mathematical formulation vs implementation-done
    * Start researching wind and solar hourly capacity factors
    * Set up structure to run lots of sensitivity tests with model formulation
        * Can then run tests for each parameter explaining the impact of it compared against other lit values
    * End of the day
        * Run accurate capacity factor hypothetical day
        * Learn more about Streamlit for GUI and see how to display visualizations from results
