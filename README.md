# KAUST
This repo contains the work I have done and any presentations I made on my work around the sustainability surrounding green ammonia and hydrogen production at KAUST for the summer in relevance to Saudi Arabia.

* Note: the workweek in Saudi Arabia is from Sunday-> Thursday and thus structured my weekly journal in accordance.
