# Green Ammonia Production Optimization
This section of the repo details the work on the green ammonia production chain side

* Data sources
    * See the input sheet for source citation

* Also see the doc folder for the formal mathematical formulation of the green ammonia production model

* Solar hourly data comes from: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/#HR

* Wind speed data comes from same source above and converted to 90 meters from 10 meters

* Wind speed then converted to power output from Vestas V90-3.0 Power profile from SAM library which has a Pout of 1800

Then converted to capacity factor
